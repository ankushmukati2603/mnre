                                            approval of Secretary, MNRE under the Chairmanship of Joint Secretary
                                            (In-charge), MNRE. PAC will evaluate and recommend the project proposals for
                                            financial support. The Ministry would issue sanction with the concurrence of
                                            IFD and approval of Secretary, MNRE. Based on this sanction/approval the
